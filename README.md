Assignment 2: Write a program using TCP socket to implement the following:
i. Server maintains records of fruits in the format: fruit-name, quantity Last-sold, (server timestamp),
ii. Multiple client purchase the fruits one at a time,
iii. The fruit quantity is updated each time any fruit is sold,
iv. Send regret message to a client if therequested quantityof the fruit is not available.
v. Display the customer ids <IP, port> who has done transactions already. This list should be updated in the server every time a transaction occurs.
vi. The total number of unique customers who did some transaction will be displayed to the customer every time.

Assignment 4: Install wireshark in a VM (Virtual Machine) environment. Draw a time diagram to show the steps in the protocols recorded in the captured file (saved in the .pcap file of wireshark) during a PING operation. List the L2, L3, L4 header fields that can be extracted from the .pcap file.

Assignment 7: Write UDP client server socket program where client sends one/two number(s) (integer or floating point) to server and a scientific calculator operation (like sin,cos,*,/, inv etc.) and server responds with the result after evaluating the value of operation as sent by the client. Server will maintain a scientific calculator. Detect in the mininet hosts with wireshark if there is any packet loss?

Asignment 8: Write a program in C using thread library and TCP sockets to build a chat server which enable clients communicating to each other through the chat server. Message logs must be maintained in the server in a text file. Each client will see the conversations in real time. Clients must handled by a server thread. (Keep it like a group chatbox)
